# tp-map
Interactive map for the game [The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess) and its [Randomizer](https://tprandomizer.com/).  
Every area of the game is mapped, including dungeons, grottos, caves, houses and shops.  
Uses and extends [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) for rendering the map.  
The maps are all handmade using an image editing software by modifying screenshots of the game's minimaps and map screen.  
Special thanks to Dajianne Mitchell-Bouchard for making the art for the rupees, doors and cave entrances.
